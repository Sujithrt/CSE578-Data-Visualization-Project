# CSE 578 - Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict whether individuals earn above or below $50K per year based on a dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau. The analysis consists of both univariate and multivariate explorations to understand how various socioeconomic factors—such as age, education, occupation, and others—influence income levels. Various machine learning models are employed to build predictive models that help in making informed decisions.

## Models Used
- `BaggingClassifier`
- `MultinomialNB`
- `LogisticRegression`
- `AdaBoostClassifier`
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `GradientBoostingClassifier`
- `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- `MLPClassifier`
- `KNeighborsClassifier`
